# Relative Solve Times

This piece of analysis was built on top of the [WCA SPV](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-spv) project.

The results of the analysis can be found on the Speedsolving.com [forum](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/relative-solve-times-for-2x2x2-7x7x7.47405/).

I still need to add the associated code to this project.
